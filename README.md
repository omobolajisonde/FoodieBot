# FoodieBot 🍟🤖

## Description
FoodieBot is a chatbot application that assists customers in placing orders for their preferred meals.

## How to use
This chatbot application is pretty intuitive to use, but here are some instructions on how to use it:
- To see the menu, enter `1`.
- To place your order, enter the number preceding the items you want to order in comma-separated values, e.g `2,3,4`.
- To checkout an order, enter `99`.
- To see order history, enter `98`.
- To see current order, enter `97`.
- To cancel current order, enter `0`.

>**Note**- If you enter any command other than the ones above, the bot will regard it as an invalid response. Also, when ordering multiple items, enter the number preceding the items on the menu in comma-separated values, e.g. `2,3,4` (no spaces).

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites & Installation
To be able to get this application up and running, ensure to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your device.

### Development Setup
1. **Download the project locally by forking this repo and then clone or just clone directly via:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/omobolajisonde/FoodieBot.git
```
2. **Create a .env file just like the example.env**
   - Assign the `SESSION_SECRET` variable a very strong secret.
   - Assign the `COOKIE_EXPIRES_IN` variable a very long time in milliseconds. 

3. **Set up the Database**
   - Create a MongoDB database on your local MongoDB server or in the cloud (Atlas).
   - Copy the connection string and assign it to the `DATABASE_URI` environment variable.
   - On connection to the database, four collections - `users`, `chats`, `menus` and `sessions` are created. Though the `sessions` collection is created by [connect-mongodb-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-mongodb-session), an external session store for the session.
   - In your terminal `cd` to the data directory and type the command `node import-data.js --import` to populate the `menus` collection with menu data. If you want to offload the `menus` collection, still in the data directory, type the command `node import-data.js --offload`.
